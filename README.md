# Research Method
## Overview
This course tries to deal with different strategies used to implement a plan to answer your research question (Research design).
So, Research design and methods are different but closely related, because good research design ensures that the data you obtain will help you answer your research question more effectively.<br>One of the most important aspects of research is the statistics associated with results or conclusion part. So, a graduate student needs to be familiar with basics concepts in statistics. Therefore, we would learn how to perform statistical tests using R Software during this course as well.
